main script: HDOCK_MMGBSA.py has three main sections:

1) ### Download PDB and CIF files for each entry in the CSV file and print the confidence numbers ###
2) ### Calculate Docking score using HDOCK ###
3) ### Calculate MMGBSA  binding affinity using gmx_MMPBSA ###

It takes as input "FINAL_DATASET.csv", read uidA and uidB and downloads PDB and CIF files (stored in CIF_FILES and PDB_FILES directories).
After that, it performs docking procedure using HDOCK software (hdock and createpl scripts) of the entries above "confidence_threshold".
Subsequently, it performs MMGBSA procedure to calculate the binding affinity.

All the output docking files are saved in the directory "HDOCK_Outputs".
All the output binding affinity files are saved in the directory "MMGBSA_Outputs".
